📝 Manual Test Instructions:

To verify the form clear fix works:

1. **Create First Plugin:**
   - Click "New Action" 
   - Fill in name: "Test Plugin 1"
   - Fill in description: "First test plugin"
   - Choose any type (e.g., SQL Schema)
   - Complete and save the plugin

2. **Create Second Plugin:**
   - Click "New Action" again
   - ✅ **Verify fields are EMPTY:**
     - Name field should be blank
     - Description field should be blank  
     - No action type should be selected
     - All form fields should be cleared

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Form should be completely clean/empty for new action
   - No previous action data should appear
   - Should be able to create new plugin without interference

4. **Previous Bug:**
   - Before fix: Previous action's name/description would remain
   - After fix: All fields should be cleared
